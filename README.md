# Clockstacker
Game creation in Matlab for Fundamentals of Engineering 1181

This was a Matlab collaboration with Henry Xiong, Jacob Schweizer, and Nathaniel DeLong.

The game is based on an old arcade game called Stacker, in which players stack as many moving rows of blocks as possible without dropping all blocks. This game was themed around The Ohio State University's new north campus clocktower.

The main game consists of constant refresh/update loops until the game ends of the player dies.
